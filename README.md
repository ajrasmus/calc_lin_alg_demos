# calc_linalg_demos

This repository contains code for visualizations and demonstrations related to calculus and linear algebra. I created this material to aid my teaching during lectures for Stanford's
class Math 51, which covers a variety of multivariable calculus and linear algebra topics.
Some interesting topics touched upon in the class include Markov chains, the spectral theorem for symmetric matrices, Newton's method,
singular value decomposition / PCA, quadratic forms, and quadratic approximations to functions.

The code is uncommented. I'm providing in case others find it useful for creating similar demos for their math lectures.
